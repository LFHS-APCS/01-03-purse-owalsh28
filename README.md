1.	In the MoneyIntro class, finish in the method  ```getDollarsFromMoney``` that takes a double as a parameter and returns how many dollars it contains.  For example, getDollarsFromMoney(34.56) would return 34.


2.	In the MoneyIntro class, finish the method  ```getCentsFromMoney``` that takes a double as a parameter and returns how many cents it contains, not including the dollars.  For example, getCentsFromMoney(34.56) would return 56.


3.	In the Purse, add the ability to use quarters, too. 

4.	In the Purse class, create a method called loadPurse that takes an integer amount in cents calculates how many quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies are needed to make change.  The results should be stored in the purse.  For example, loadPurse(84) would set the purse to 3 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies.  

IMPORTANT: Use +, -, *, /, %, and = operators only, no if/while needed.
